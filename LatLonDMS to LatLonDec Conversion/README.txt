The National Geodetic Survey's NAD83 converter outputs latitudes
and longitudes in degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS).  It is frequently desirable to work with latitudes and longitudes in decimal degrees.

This program converts the latitudes and longitudes in DMS to latitudes and longitudes
in decimal degrees.

A note on the converter:

The converter can be found at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/SPCS83/.  It converts
NAD83 coordinates to latitudes and longitudes, which is especially useful if
you are displaying data with a garden-variety mapping API.
