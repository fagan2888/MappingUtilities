This program converts a text file with simple series of NAD83 coordinates to
blue book format.  The National Geodetic Survey's NAD83 converter requires
blue book format.

The converter can be found at http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/SPCS83/.  It converts
NAD83 coordinates to latitudes and longitudes, which is especially useful if
you are displaying data with a garden-variety mapping API.
